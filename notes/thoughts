Consider Alternatives (PyBullet + Jetson):

    could still use PyBullet for initial development and training.
    Train models (EBM, perception, agent).
    Develop ROS 2 nodes.
    Optimize the models for the Jetson using TensorRT.
    Deploy and test on the Jetson.
    Isaac Sim might face a larger sim-to-real gap, potentially requiring more tuning on the real hardware.
