What is the Levi-Civita Connection, Intuitively?
The Levi-Civita connection tells how to differentiate vectors in curved space so that your math respects:

The geometry of the space (it preserves the metric).

The natural flow of motion (it’s torsion-free, i.e., doesn’t introduce artificial “twisting”).

This is the tool that lets you:

Compute covariant derivatives (i.e., how a drone’s velocity or orientation changes along a curved trajectory).

Define acceleration and geodesics correctly.

Perform parallel transport, which is critical for synchronized yet decentralized motion.
