--- Testing Recall ---

Testing recall for: 'glide_noisy' (should recall 'glide')
Recall initiated (max_steps=50)...
Converged after 2 steps.
  Converged: True in 2 steps.
  Final State: [-1  1  1 -1 -1 -1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1 -1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1 -1 -1  1  1 -1]
  Identified as: 'Unknown'
  Result: FAILED (Expected 'glide')

Testing recall for: 'flap_noisy' (should recall 'flap')
Recall initiated (max_steps=50)...
Converged after 2 steps.
  Converged: True in 2 steps.
  Final State: [-1 -1  1 -1  1 -1 -1  1 -1 -1  1  1 -1 -1 -1  1 -1 -1  1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1]
  Identified as: 'flap'
  Result: SUCCESS

Testing recall for: 'hover_noisy' (should recall 'hover')
Recall initiated (max_steps=50)...
Converged after 2 steps.
  Converged: True in 2 steps.
  Final State: [ 1 -1  1 -1  1  1 -1 -1 -1 -1  1  1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1  1]
