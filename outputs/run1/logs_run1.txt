The results show that the network successfully
 trained and loaded the patterns, but the recall performance is quite low 
 (only 1 out of 4 noisy patterns recalled correctly, a 25% success rate).

Specifically:

glide_noisy recalled 'hover' (FAILED)
flap_noisy recalled 'flap' (SUCCESS)
hover_noisy recalled 'turn' (FAILED)
turn_noisy recalled 'hover' (FAILED)

. A Hopfield network of size N (number of neurons) can store roughly 0.14 * N patterns.

N=8, so the theoretical capacity is only about 0.14 * 8 â‰ˆ 1.12 patterns. 
4 patterns (glide, flap, hover, turn) in a network of size 8 severely overloads its capacity. 
The energy landscape becomes too complex with many spurious minima, and the basins of attraction for the correct patterns get distorted or shrink.


SOLUTION PATH:

modify test_input.py
+Increase the size from 8 to 24.
