--- Testing Recall ---

Testing recall for: 'glide_noisy' (should recall 'glide')
Recall initiated (max_steps=50)...
Converged after 2 steps.
  Converged: True in 2 steps.
  Final State: [ 1 -1 -1 -1 -1  1  1  1 -1  1  1 -1  1  1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1  1  1 -1 -1]
  Identified as: 'Unknown'
  Result: FAILED (Expected 'glide')

Testing recall for: 'flap_noisy' (should recall 'flap')
Recall initiated (max_steps=50)...
Converged after 3 steps.
  Converged: True in 3 steps.

EVALUATE:

Results:
The results show a 75% success rate with the larger pattern size (N=24), a significant improvement from the 25% you got with N=8.

flap, hover, and turn were recalled correctly.
glide_noisy failed, converging to an "Unknown" state.
